# rsc-fun-in-bun "toy" project

## TODO: High level subjective goals

- [ ] Understand what the heck "RSC" actually is and how it works
- [ ] Build a toy implementation of something vaguely RSC-ish, that runs in bun.sh

## TODO: low level concrete goals

- [ ] document RSC & "use client" & "use server"
- [ ] toy tests can be run with `bun test`
- [ ] toy supports "use client" at the top of a file
- [ ] toy supports "use server" at the top of a file
- [ ] toy supports "use server" at the top of an async function

### TODO: Tasks
